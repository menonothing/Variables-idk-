It is not useful probably in a practical sense, there are libraries like Numpy which does this and many other things better than this program would run;

along with that, I'm sure their time and space complexity would be abysmal compared to my fun project/s

aim -to make computers- recognize variables, some commonly used functions and exponents, and simplify equations ;

around 70-80% of the work is done, I will update this line once I finish the code;


PS- the file name doesn't and won't make sense don't waste your time mulling over it

PS- the time and space complexity is terrible, I should probably learn DSA and stuff, and not jump into coding after going through Python syntaxes once

indefinite hold, i just completed the code but realised the time and space complexity are horrendous, i dont think my computer can ever run it, will update this after im confident enough in my skills
