It is not useful probably in a practical sense, there are libraries like Numpy which does this and many other things better than this program would run;

along with that, I'm sure their time and space complexity would be abysmal compared to my fun project/s

aim -to make computers- recognize variables, some commonly used functions and exponents, and simplify equations ;

pseudo code has been made and recorded as comments in the code itself, I'd say around 60-70% of the work is done, I will update this line once I finish this code;

PS- the file name doesn't and won't make sense don't waste your time mulling over it
