not actually useful probably in practical sense, there are libraries like Numpy which does this and many other things better than this program would run
along with that, i suspect their time and space complexity would be abysmal compared to my fun project

I aim to make computer- recognise variable, some commonly used functions and exponents, and simplify equations 
pseudo code has been made and recorded as comments in code itself, i'd say around 60-70% or the work is done, will update this line once I finish this code
